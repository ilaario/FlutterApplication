    "Front Wing Aero": "\nIncreasing the front wing angle results in higher downforce at the front of the car, which enhances front-end grip, especially during cornering. This allows the driver to take corners at higher speeds with more precision and stability. However, this increase in downforce also generates more aerodynamic drag, which can reduce top speed on straights. Conversely, decreasing the front wing angle reduces downforce, leading to less grip in corners but decreasing drag, thus improving straight-line speed. Finding the right balance is key to optimizing both cornering performance and top speed.",
